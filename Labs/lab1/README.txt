If I had to create a digit display with only LEDs I would:
*Place the LEDs in a pattern resembling an '8' since it is the easiest
to create other numbers with.
*I would create a disjunctive normal form equation for each LED. EX:
The bottom LED would have a truth table that would be T for numbers 2,3,
5,6,8,0,B,C,D,E since all of those numbers and letters have lines at the 
bottom. This would require an input of at least 4 bits.


I imagine that the random number generator used in most computers
has something to do with time. Since time is constantly changing, easy
to measure, and requires pretty much no extra hardware, basing
each number in a series off of a time-based input could create a decent
pseudorandom number generator. (By "time" I am referring to the local
computer's time, not global time.) Take the current binary value of time,
run it through a series of logic gates, and then take the output
as an integer value.
