Lab 3
Section 2

Description & Purpose:
----------------------
In this lab, I learned how to write code using mars in the MIPS assembly language. I learned how registers
worked and how to manipulate strings.

Methods:
--------
Implementing the section that converts the string into an int. was very hard. I figured out that I can iterate
through the string and assign values by subtracting 48 from the ascii input.


Challenges:
-----------
It was very challenging to wrap my head around the idea of programming in assembly. Not being able to call
functions that I used to take for granted was very frustrating.
